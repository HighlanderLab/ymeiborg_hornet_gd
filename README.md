This repository contains the code used to model gene drives in haplo-diploid social insects for the publications

  Meiborg, A.B., Faber, N.R., Taylor, B.A. et al. The suppressive potential of a gene drive in populations of
  invasive social wasps is currently limited. Sci Rep 13, 1640 (2023). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-28867-8

The code was run in R 4.0.0 and AlphaSimR 1.0.4.

First, make sure R and the required packages are installed. Then, to load the model function, source the model_function.R file and make sure the AltphaSimR.R file is in the same folder.

Specify the inputs as indicated in the figure scripts under the input section. See comments there and he Material and Methods section of the paper for explanation of the different parameters.

Run the model as indicated in the figure scripts under the "Run model" section.
